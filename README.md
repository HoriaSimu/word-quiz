# word-quiz
This is a small homework project done to learn working with react.js.

It is a single page app that tests the user's knowledge of foreign words, in a similar manner to duolingo's word memorizing cards. Upon starting the app, the user can choose between 3 languages and set up the length of the test (5-15 words). The app will display one picture at a time and ask for the user's input. After testing the chosen number of words, it will display the score.

You can see it in action on GitHub Pages: https://gherazaurul.github.io/word-quiz/

It has not been thoroughly tested on all browsers, but it works fine on recent versions of Firefox.

## To do

The app is more or less finished, but there's certainly room for improvement.

- [x] Replace images with smaller size versions
- [ ] Randomize word list upon each restart
- [ ] Add a more descriptive score display
- [ ] Add a function to move the cursor automatically to the next letter fields when typing
- [ ] Rework the stylesheet
- [ ] Add animations
